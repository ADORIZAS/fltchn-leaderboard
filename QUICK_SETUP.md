# Quick Setup Guide - What I Can Automate

I understand you want me to set up everything automatically. Here's what I can do vs what requires your approval:

## ✅ I Can Automate (Will Do Now):

1. **Create all project files** (if not already created)
2. **Set up local development environment**
3. **Install all dependencies**
4. **Create configuration files**
5. **Initialize Git repository**
6. **Create helper scripts**

## ⚠️ Requires Your Manual Approval:

I cannot automatically:
- Create accounts on Firebase, Vercel, Railway (requires OAuth)
- Download service account keys (requires login)
- Authorize GitHub connections
- Set up API keys (requires account creation)

## 🚀 Let's Proceed

I'll now:
1. Verify/create all project files
2. Set up the local environment
3. Create a step-by-step guide for the manual approvals you need to make

Then you can approve the account creations and I'll guide you through connecting everything.
