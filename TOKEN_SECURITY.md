# ⚠️ Token Security Reminder

## Important Security Notes

Your Personal Access Token has been used to push to GitHub. Here are important security reminders:

### ✅ What I Did
- Used your token to push code to GitHub
- Removed token from git remote URL (for security)
- Your token is saved in macOS Keychain (via credential helper)

### 🔒 Security Best Practices

1. **Don't Share Your Token**
   - Never commit tokens to git
   - Never share tokens in public places
   - If exposed, revoke immediately and create new one

2. **Token is Saved**
   - macOS Keychain has saved your credentials
   - Future pushes won't require re-entering token
   - This is secure and convenient

3. **If Token is Compromised**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Find your token
   - Click "Revoke"
   - Create a new token

4. **Token Expiration**
   - Your token will expire based on the expiration you set
   - When expired, create a new token
   - Or use GitHub CLI for long-term solution
